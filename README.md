Answer to the SO question at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2169649/get-pick-an-image-from-androids-built-in-gallery-app-programmatically/2636538

    I am trying to open an image / picture in the Gallery built-in app from inside my application.
    I have a URI of the picture (the picture is located on the SD card).
    Do you have any suggestions?

## Getting started

Clone this project on your system and use Android studio to import this project using menu options:

    File > New Project > Import Project


## TODO

* check support for Astro filemanager
* Getting a single picture doesn't seem to be working on the newest Android version 4.4 (KitKat) anymore. The _data column from the query returns a null value
